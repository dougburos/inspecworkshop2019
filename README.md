Concerned about Compliance and Security? This workshop introduces you to the power of InSpec. Learn through hands on labs how to detect and correct with InSpec to ensure you have a secure and compliant infrastructure.

The InSpec Jumpstart workshop starts from ground zero. You will learn the basic of InSpec, what are controls and profiles, and how its invoked on local and remote target nodes. You will see how run Chef to remediate noncompliance issues that are identified, and how to automate that end-2-end process with Chef Automate.
